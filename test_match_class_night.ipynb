On a length on off, Mitchell lofts this one over the mid on region and he finds the ropes.\\n99.6--Mitchell Starc--NO BALL AND FOUR. Starc takes on Saini and dispatches him nicely.

That is hammered! Tossed up delivery on off, Pant comes down the track and lofts it over covers for a maximum.\\n56.2--Rishabh Pant--SIX! This is even better! Flighted delivery on middle, Pant comes down the track and lofts it over long on for a biggie.'},\n",

A shortish ball on middle, Starc sits back and pulls it all the way\\xa0towards the deep mid-wicket boundary for a maximum. He then gives a glaring look at Saini who just turns around and walks back.\\nSecond innings...\\n64.3--Steven Smith--SIX! That's gone the distance! Short and on middle, Smith pulls it fine over fine leg and gets a top edge on it. The ball sails over the fence for a biggie. Looks to be the norm of the session though.\\n83.4--Cameron Green--SIX! BRUTAL! Length ball on off, Green makes room by coming down the track and then lofts it high and over mid-wicket for a biggie.\\n85.5--Cameron Green--SIX! MASSIVE! A length ball in the slot, Green clears his front leg and slogs this one over the long on boundary for his second maximum of the innings. The intent is clear here from Green and Australia. He has been given the license to go for the\\xa0kill by his skipper.\\n85.6--Cameron Green--SIX! Consecutive maximums for Green. A fuller length ball around off, Grren again goes for the slog, this time it doesn't come of the middle of the bat but has enough power to clear the ropes at the long on boundary. Declaration coming up soon? Australia now lead by 395 runs.\\n86.5--Cameron Green--SIX! WHAT A SHOT! A shortish ball outside off, Green shuffles and pulls this over the ropes at deep square leg. That was a massive hit as it went way over the ropes into the stands. Green now moves onto 84. Can he get\\xa0his hundred here?\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"First Innings....\\n3.3 David Warner OUT! EDGED AND CAUGHT! India draw first blood! Warner's comeback does not end on a happy note for the left-hander and for the Aussies! Siraj, again, continues his good form in this Test series and he breaks this new opening stand. Siraj dishes this on a length around off, it moves away after pitching, Warner is drawn into the shot and he swings his blade at this. He can only induce an outside edge and the ball flies towards the slip cordon. Pujara is the man there at first slip and he is not going to drop this.\\n34.2 Will Pucovski OUT! LBW! Saini has his first wicket! What a moment this is for the youngster! A debutant gets the other debutant and Saini is ecstatic. India needed to break this partnership and Navdeep has decided to take matters into his own hands. He bowls this on a length outside off, moves in after taking the deck, Pucovski takes too long to get his bat across and misses his flick away. Gets rapped on the pads. The players appeal and the umpire obliges raising his finger. Will is not going to review this one as he knows that this was plumb. A fine, fine stand comes to an end.\\n70.5 Marnus Labuschagne OUT! CAUGHT! Jadeja gets the breakthrough and Marnus, who was looking to get to his ton loses his wicket. The skipper takes a really good catch. Makes it to 91, but will not be able to cross the triple digit mark. Just the wicket that India needed and also at the right time. Jadeja goes for a short one and around the off pole, Labuschagne camps on his back foot and looks to punch\\xa0this one away but the ball bounces a tad bit more and also spins away slightly, just enough to take\\xa0the outside edge and go\\xa0towards the first slip region, where Rahane gets low and makes no mistake. A sad end to Marnus' innings.\\n76.5 Matthew Wade OUT! CAUGHT! Jadeja gets another wicket and sends another batter to the hut! There is always a sense of adventure about Wade and that adventure has made sure that he loses his wicket. He was looking good with his short stay out in the middle but that has been cut short by Jadeja and he is doing well to get wickets at regular intervals. Wade skips down the track as Jadeja goes for a flatter delivery around middle, Wade looks to tuck this one away to the leg side but he gets a leading edge and the ball balloons towards the mid on region, where Bumrah takes a good catch.\\n84.5 Cameron Green OUT! LBW! Excellent bowling this by Bumrah. Green goes for a duck. After dishing out balls outside off, Bumrah\\xa0bowls a length ball around off, makes it to jag back in. Green looks to defend but gets beaten by the pace and movement to get hit on the pads. The Indians appeal and the umpire obliges by raising his finger. Green has a word with Smith but decides against the review. A good decision as replays show that this would go onto hit the stumps. Green does not hang around for long.\\n88.5 Tim Paine OUT! BOWLED! Knocked him over. Bumrah, you beauty! A fuller ball around off, comes back in slightly and Paine looks to have a push at this but plays it at the wrong line, there was not foot movement as well. The ball goes through the forward push of the Australian captain and goes onto disturb the timber behind. Bumrah has been lethal with the second new ball and has shown it again. Paine completely misjudged the line there and has to make his\\xa0way back to the pavilion. Australia 6 down now.\\n94.4 Pat Cummins OUT! TIMBER! Jadeja gets another one and the decision to bring on Jadeja is a masterclass by Rahane. Cummins goes back for a duck as well. Jadeja bowls this very full and around off, Cummins is late in getting his blade down in time to dig this one out. Cummins misses out. But the ball does not as it goes onto hit the off pole. A very good wicket for India and Australia lose their seventh wicket.\\n101.5 Mitchell Starc OUT! CAUGHT! The rush of blood to Starc has made him lose his wicket! Shortish ball around middle and leg, Starc goes for the slog, but has no timing on that whatsoever. The ball balloons up in the air towards mid-wicket area, Gill\\xa0from mid on runs to his left and completes an easy catch. A good cameo from Starc comes to an end. Australia 8 down now. How many more can they add now?\\n102.4 Nathan Lyon OUT! LBW! That had to be plumb! Jadeja gets his fourth wicket of the game and even the review is not able to save Lyon. A full toss on off and middle, Lyon looks to play at this but he misses. It hits him on his boot. The players appeal and the umpire obliges, raising his finger. Lyon walks back but takes the review just to be sure. Ultra Edge shows not bat involved. Ball Tracker comes in and confirms that the on-field call is the right one. One last wicket remaining to take for the Indians.\\n105.4 Steven Smith OUT! RUN OUT! Steven Smith is run out looking to turn the this single into this double. You can't take Jadeja on like that but he will be very happy with the knock that he has played. On a length and around off, Smith looked to push this one to the off side but the ball takes the inside edge and goes to the square leg region. They go for the single but Smith pushes for the double. Jadeja runs in and has a shy at the keeper's end and he hits bulls eye. The umpire wants to check this upstairs. Replays roll in and Smith is well short. AUSTRALIA END THEIR FIRST INNINGS WITH 338.\\nSecond innings...\\n5.5 Will Pucovski OUT! CAUGHT! This is a beautiful delivery\\xa0by Siraj. A length ball around off, shapes away affter pitching. Pucovski looks to defend but is surprised by the movement. The ball takes the outside edge and goes towards Saha, the substitute keeper, who pouches it nicely\\xa0by diving to his right. Siraj is rewarded for bowling some good lines here. Australia lose their 1st wicket.\\n9.2 David Warner OUT! LBW! Umpire's call on hitting the wickets. Ashwin has his man early in his spell. Both the Aussie openers dismissed inside the first 10 overs. A tossed up ball around off and middle, Warner gets down and looks to play the sweep but misses to get hit on the pads. Looks pretty good as the Indians appeal. The umpire takes his time and then raises the finger. Warner signals the 'T' after having a word with his partner at the other end. Hot Spot and Snicko detetcs nothing. Ball Tracker shows that the ball would clip the stumps. So, Warner has to go.\\n46.1 Marnus Labuschagne OUT! CAUGHT! Taken down the leg side! The substitute keeper Saha takes a sensational take! A crucial stand is broken. Bowls a fast one on a length on leg, Labuschagne as he does so well looks to help it on its way to the leg side but the extra bit of bounce there means the ball goes off the edge and towards the left of the keeper. Saha, the substitute keeper dives full length to that side to pouch it. Can India capitalise on this opening?\\n48.6 Matthew Wade OUT! CAUGHT! EDGED AND GONE! Wade's poor run continues as Saini has his second of the innings. Beautifully bowled there by Navdeep Saini. Bowls a length ball and gets it to rear up a bit around off, Wade looks to defend it off the back foot but ends up getting a thick outside edge which is pouched safely by the substitute keeper, Saha.\\n67.4 Steven Smith OUT! LBW! THREE REDS! Just what India wanted and the technology comes to their assistance there. Ashwin bowls a nice tossed up ball around off,\\xa0 gets it to turn a bit towards Smith. Steven there comes on the front foot to defend but the ball spins past him and raps him flush on the pads. Ashwin appeals and there is a shake of head from the umpire. Rahane signals 'T' immediately. Replays roll in. Firstly it is a fair delivery as Hot Spot does not show bat involved. Snicko comes in and confirms the same. Time for Hawk Eye now. Pitching in line, Impact in Line and Wickets Hitting. Three reds and Smith has to take the long walk back. India would be relieved to see the back of Steven Smith and now would hope to wrap the Australian innings quickly to set up the chase here.\\n86.6 Cameron Green OUT! CAUGHT! Right at the stroke of Tea Green departs! End of an entertaining knock comes to an end. Bumrah finally has a wicket to his name in the second innings. Bowls a good length ball around off, Green looks to smash that through the off side but ends up getting an inside edge to the keeper. Saha takes it and goes up in an appeal. The umpire raises his finger there. After discussing with the skipper Green takes the review. Replays roll in and there is nothing on the Hot Spot but the Snicko detects a spike when the ball goes past the bat. The on field call stays as Green walks back. THAT WILL BE TEA ON DAY 4!\"},\n",

       "  'answer': \"First Innings....\\n26.6 Rohit Sharma OUT! CAUGHT! A soft, soft dismissal and Sharma has just given Hazlewood a late New Year's present. It was all one way traffic until now but Josh has broken this promising stand. A very sharp catch by Josh. He bowls this on a length and around off, Sharma looks to drive this one past the bowler but does so slightly uppishly. It is enough for Hazlewood to get low to his left and grab this one out of thin air. The 70-run stand between these two comes to an end and the Aussies will be glad that they got a breakthrough.\\n32.1 Shubman Gill OUT! CAUGHT! A good innings by Gill but unfortunately for him, it comes to an end. It has been a controlled innings by him so far but all it takes is one ball from someone of Cummins' caliber to send him packing. A fine catch by Green as well. Cummins darts in a good length delivery around the off pole, the ball moves away ever so slightly after taking the deck, Gill look to block this one but the ball takes the outside edge and flies towards the gully fielder and Green, there, gets low and takes a delightful catch.\\n54.4 Ajinkya Rahane OUT! Dragged on! Big, big wicket. The one the Aussies dearly wanted. A shortish ball around off, this one comes back in a touch as Rahane looks to run it down towards third man. However, he ends up getting a big inside edge which goes onto the shatter the stumps. That kept low. Rahane cannot believe what has happened there. Massive, massive moment in the game. The dropped chance doesn't cost Australia much and the centurion from the last game has been removed. He was starting to look positive there but Cummins gets the better of him.\\n67.2 Hanuma Vihari OUT! RUN OUT! Vihari is short. Stunning work from Hazlewood. A fuller ball just outside off, Vihari jumps out of his crease and pushes it wide of the man at mid off. He calls for the single straightaway and Pujara responds. Hazlewood from mid off dives to his right, stops the ball and hits the stumps at the non-striker's end, did that all in one motion. The Aussies celebrate. The third umpire has been called for and one replay is enough to send Vihari packing. His\\xa0stay in the middle has been cut short, because of some stunning work from the big Josh.\\n87.4 Rishabh Pant OUT! TAKEN! Pant's stay has been cut short. Hazlewood is the man who strikes. A fuller ball outside off, Pant without any feet movement goes for the drive but ends up getting an outside edge. The ball goes to Warner at first slip. It goes quickly to him but he reacts sharply and holds onto it. Great take from the southpaw. Not from the one with the bat though as it was way outside off and he could've had easily left it alone. A start thrown away again by Pant.\\n88.2 Cheteshwar Pujara OUT! GONE! Huge wicket. Cummins is the man who has done it again. Big, big wicket. Excellent from Cummins. Good length and around off, it shoots off a touch after pitching. Pujara is glued in his crease as he pokes at it. The ball takes the gloves and goes behind. Paine is not going to miss out. A simple catch for him and he gobbles it. The battling knock from Pujara comes to an end and that leaves India in a massive trouble. They are still 143 behind.\\n92.2 Ravindra Jadeja OUT! RUN OUT!\\xa0Ashwin is short. Poor, poor running from him. A fullish ball outside off, Jadeja drives this to the left of fielder at mid off and takes off for the run. Ashwin is slow to react to it. Cummins from mid\\xa0off\\xa0throws the ball to Marnus Labuschagne at the striker's end and he whips off the bails before Ashwin can make his ground. Third umpire has been called and the replays show Ashwin short by some margin.\\xa0Waste of a wicket this by Ashwin. Second run out of the innings this. India 7 down now.\\n94.5 Navdeep Saini OUT! TAKEN! Starc gets the wicket with that short ball tactics. Smart from Paine to bring him back. Not that smart from Jadeja to expose Saini for entire six balls against Starc. Another short ball around off and middle, Saini is hopping to fend it away. This time the Aussies brought a man at silly point. The ball hits the upper part of the bat and it goes to Wade. Wade is not dropping this. Perfectly planned wicket.\\n96.3 Ravindra Jadeja OUT! RUN OUT! 3rd run out of the innings. Jadeja clips this fuller ball towards deep square leg and immediately calls for two. The fielder from short leg, Labuschagne\\xa0chases the ball down and scores\\xa0a direct hit at the non-striker's end. Third umpire has been called for and replays show that Bumrah is well short there and has to make his way back to the pavilion. Australia have been excellent in the field especially with the direct\\xa0hits. India 9 down now.\\n100.4 Mohammed Siraj OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! There is a spike as the ball gets closer to the bat, as shown by the Snicko. After banging three short, Cummins bowls a length ball just outside off, Siraj pokes at it without moving his feet. He ends up nicking it behind and the Aussies celebrate.The finger goes up but Siraj signals the 'T'. Replays roll in and they show a big spike on the Snicko. So, the onfield call will stay. India are bowled out for 244.\\nSecond innings...\\n22.1 Shubman Gill OUT! Caught! Australia get the breakthrough. Length and around off, Gill looks to play this one off the back foot as he stays grounded inside the crease. The ball though shapes away a little as it takes the outside edge. There is an appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Gill though takes it upstairs as the replays roll in. Hot Spot comes in and it detects a spot when the ball is near the bat. Gill wastes a review as he walks back to the hut. Once again India fail to continue after a good opening stand.\\n30.2 Rohit Sharma OUT! CAUGHT! Sharma departs against the run of play! Rohit looks disappointed there. He got out to a shot which he loves playing and has fetched runs for him but this time it is not to be. Cummins nicely sets up the wicket by bowling it on a length on the first ball and now he bowls a short one and invites Rohit to go for the pull. Sharma obliges but fails to get the distance this time as the fielder at fine leg, Mitchell Starc takes it with ease. India once again lose both their openers after a good start.\\n35.4 Ajinkya Rahane OUT! CAUGHT! What a catch! That is nothing than a reaction catch. Australia needed it and Lyon delivers it. India disappointed after a failure from their skipper. Tossed up on off, Rahane prods forward to defend but does not play for the extra spin there as the ball takes the inside edge and goes towards short leg who takes a good low catch. Matthew Wade it is there under the helmet.\"},\n",

The Indians appeal and the umpire obliges by raising his finger. Green has a word with Smith but decides against the review. A good decision as replays show that this would go onto hit the stumps. Green does not hang around for long.86.6 OUT! CAUGHT! Right at the stroke of Tea Green departs! End of an entertaining knock comes to an end. Bumrah finally has a wicket to his name in the second innings. Bowls a good length ball around off, Green looks to smash that through the off side but ends up getting an inside edge to the keeper. Saha takes it and goes up in an appeal. The umpire raises his finger there. After discussing with the skipper Green takes the review. Replays roll in and there is nothing on the Hot Spot but the Snicko detects a spike when the ball goes past the bat. The on field call stays as Green walks back. THAT WILL BE TEA ON DAY 4!'},\n",

There is always a sense of adventure about Wade and that adventure has made sure that he loses his wicket. He was looking good with his short stay out in the middle but that has been cut short by Jadeja and he is doing well to get wickets at regular intervals. Wade skips down the track as Jadeja goes for a flatter delivery around middle, Wade looks to tuck this one away to the leg side but he gets a leading edge and the ball balloons towards the mid on region, where Bumrah takes a good catch.48.6 OUT! CAUGHT! EDGED AND GONE! Wade's poor run continues as Saini has his second of the innings. Beautifully bowled there by Navdeep Saini. Bowls a length ball and gets it to rear up a bit around off, Wade looks to defend it off the back foot but ends up getting a thick outside edge which is pouched safely by the substitute keeper, Saha.\"},\n",

Jadeja goes for a short one and around the off pole, Labuschagne camps on his back foot and looks to punch\\xa0this one away but the ball bounces a tad bit more and also spins away slightly, just enough to take\\xa0the outside edge and go\\xa0towards the first slip region, where Rahane gets low and makes no mistake. A sad end to Marnus' innings.46.1 OUT! CAUGHT! Taken down the leg side! The substitute keeper Saha takes a sensational take! A crucial stand is broken. Bowls a fast one on a length on leg, Labuschagne as he does so well looks to help it on its way to the leg side but the extra bit of bounce there means the ball goes off the edge and towards the left of the keeper.

India needed to break this partnership and Navdeep has decided to take matters into his own hands. He bowls this on a length outside off, moves in after taking the deck, Pucovski takes too long to get his bat across and misses his flick away. Gets rapped on the pads. The players appeal and the umpire obliges raising his finger. Will is not going to review this one as he knows that this was plumb. A fine, fine stand comes to an end.5.5 OUT! CAUGHT!

Siraj, again, continues his good form in this Test series and he breaks this new opening stand. Siraj dishes this on a length around off, it moves away after pitching, Warner is drawn into the shot and he swings his blade at this. He can only induce an outside edge and the ball flies towards the slip cordon. Pujara is the man there at first slip and he is not going to drop this.9.2 OUT! LBW! Umpire's call on hitting the wickets. Ashwin has his man early in his spell. Both the Aussie openers dismissed inside the first 10 overs. A tossed up ball around off and middle, Warner gets down and looks to play the sweep but misses to get hit on the pads. Looks pretty good as the Indians appeal. The umpire takes his time and then raises the finger. Warner signals the 'T' after having a word with his partner at the other end. Hot Spot and Snicko detetcs nothing.

      "5.4--Will Pucovski--FOUR! First boundary of the innings! Short of a length delivery on middle, Pucovski looks to pull but gets a top edge. It goes towards fine leg for a boundary.\n",
      "10.5--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR. Good shot. Marnus takes the ball on this time and he dispatches this one to the ropes. This one is shorter in length and on middle, Labuschagne swivel-pulls this one to the deep square leg region to find the ropes.\n",
      "14.6--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Well played by Marnus! He sends this one past the ropes! On a fuller length around off, Labuschagne punches this one through the mid on region, where the fielder dives, but is not able to stop the ball, which then runs past the ropes.\n",
      "23.2--Will Pucovski--FOUR! Good footwork by Will and he bags a boundary! Also, brings up 50 runs for the Aussies. Short and outside off, Pucovski makes some room and slaps this one through the cover region, past the diving fielder there and into the ropes.\n",
      "27.4--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Marnus sends one to the ropes now! Uses the crease well on this occasion. Ashwin, again goes for a short delivery around off, Labuschagne goes back deep in his crease and slaps this one through the cover region again and the ball speeds away to the ropes.\n",
      "27.5--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Back-to-back boundaries for Labuschagne! The man in the deep tried to stop this one but he failed! Flatter on middle, Marnus flicks this one through the square leg region and the ball touches the ropes, as the fielder tried to stop it.\n",
      "29.5--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Cracking shot! Short delivery on off, Labuschagne punches it through covers for a boundary.\n",
      "30.1--Will Pucovski--FOUR! Cracking shot! What a welcome this is to International Test cricket for Saini! This is from a debutant to a debutant and Will sends this one to the ropes. Short delivery on off, Pucovski punches it through covers for a boundary. He also moves onto 49 with this shot.\n",
      "30.2--Will Pucovski--FOUR! 50 for Will Pucovski! It has been a fine innings from him on debut! Sure, he has got a couple of lives here but he has still shown his class with his strokeplay and he will be hoping to turn this into a big, big score. Short delivery on middle, Pucovski pulls it through mid-wicket for a boundary.\n",
      "35.6--Steven Smith--FOUR! SWEET SHOT! Smith is looking aggressive in his approach and he punches this one away to the ropes. Bumrah goes for a length delivery around off, Smith, uses the pace on the ball and then hammers this one through the mid off region to bag a boundary.\n",
      "36.3--Steven Smith--FOUR! SHOT! Goes down the ground again, fetches the boundary ropes again! Smith is looking in fine touch! A length delivery, around off, Smith punches this one through mid on and finds the ropes.\n",
      "36.5--Steven Smith--FOUR! Another one! Great timing on this one. On a good length, straying on the pads, Smith clips this one through the square leg region for another boundary.\n",
      "39.6--Steven Smith--FOUR! Smith is definitely ready for this game! He is playing some good strokes! Floats it up nicely, does Ashwin, and dishes this one on middle, Smith clips this one through mid-wicket for a boundary. Smith moves to 19 off just 20 balls. He does not want to let Ashwin get into his rhythm.\n",
      "41.1--Steven Smith--FOUR! Nice use of the feet! Tossed up delivery on middle, Smith comes down the track and lofts it over mid on for a boundary. Some more aggression being shown by Smith. Wants to dominate Ashwin now, does he! Also, moves to 24 off 25 deliveries.\n",
      "42.3--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! 50 for Marnus Labuschagne! Full delivery on off, Labuschagne drives it through covers for a boundary. His ninth in Test cricket and his first one against India. He has looked real good out there and will want to convert this double digit score into a three digit score.\n",
      "42.5--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Nice shot! Full ball on off, Marnus drives it through mid off for a boundary. Taking the charge now, is Marnus. Boundaries are coming in good quantity for the Aussies.\n",
      "47.3--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Fifty partnership up between these two as well. Good batting by them so far. Floated on off, Labuschagne skips down the track and lofts this one over the bowler's head and it crosses the ropes on a couple of bounces.\n",
      "56.1--Steven Smith--FOUR. Brilliantly played by Smith. First boundary of the Day. Easy pickings for Smith. A half-volley around the off pole, Smith leans in and drives the ball through the cover region and he bags a boundary.\n",
      "65.2--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Aerial but safe. A length ball around middle, Labuschagne flicks this one past the diving fielder at square leg and collects his first boundary for the morning.\n",
      "66.1--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! What a good shot! Slashes this one wonderfully. Flat and around off, Labuschagne makes some room and slashes this one through the point region and the ball speeds away to the ropes.\n",
      "70.3--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! This time Labuschagne doesn't miss out. A short and wide ball, he rocks back and cuts it through cover point to collect a boundary. Also 100-run partnership comes up between Smith and Labuschagne with that shot. Marnus moves into the 90's now.\n",
      "71.4--Steven Smith--FOUR! FIFTY FOR STEVEN SMITH! His 30th Test half-century and his fourth against India and he will be very happy with this. Will be looking to cross that magical 100 number now. Has struggled in this series but this innings has been very brave from him. Floated and on off, Smith punches this one down the ground and beats the fielder there to find the ropes.\n",
      "72.6--Steven Smith--FOUR! Well played! Floated on off, Smith drives this one through the cover region and finds the fence. Smith continues on his merry way.\n",
      "74.2--Matthew Wade--FOUR! SMACKED! Wade is good at playing these shots and he shows it again. Tosses it up and lands it around off, Wade punches this one through the extra cover region and the ball speeds away to the ropes.\n",
      "75.3--Steven Smith--FOUR! Nicely done. Floated on middle and leg, Smith goes for the sweep and connects that well. The ball races away through the gap at square leg area for a boundary. Smith showing some aggression against Ashwin here.\n",
      "76.1--Matthew Wade--FOUR! Good shot by Wade again! Gets another boundary. Floated on off, Wade punches this one through the mid on region to bag another boundary.\n",
      "78.2--Steven Smith--FOUR! Smith is marching on at the moment, regardless of who partners him at the other end. Flatter and outside off, Smith cuts this one through the point region to bag a boundary.\n",
      "78.4--Steven Smith--FOUR! He is so good at reading the length and he dispatches this one too! Short and around off, Smith punches this one through covers for a boundary.\n",
      "90.2--Steven Smith--FOUR! A mere push. A short of a length around off, Smith stands tall and pushes this one through the covers for a boundary.\n",
      "91.2--Steven Smith--FOUR! Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. What a shot to get into your 90s. A fuller ball around off, Smith whips this one through the mid-wicket region, through the carpet, into the ropes.\n",
      "97.2--Mitchell Starc--FOUR! SHOT! Growing in confidence, is Starc. On a length on off, Mitchell lofts this one over the mid on region and he finds the ropes.\n",
      "99.6--Mitchell Starc--NO BALL AND FOUR. Starc takes on Saini and dispatches him nicely. Short and on middle, Starc pulls this one to the fine leg region for a boundary. A No Ball too as Saini had overstepped.\n",
      "102.1--Steven Smith--FOUR! WHACKED! Floated on off, Smith gets on his knees and slog sweeps this one towards the deep mid-wicket fence for a boundary.\n",
      "103.2--Steven Smith--FOUR! Nicely done. A shortish ball outside off, Smith waits for it and upper cuts this one above the slips to get himself another boundary.\n",
      "105.1--Steven Smith--FOUR! Extraordinary batting this by Smith. A short ball around off, Smith plays the tennis forehand kind of shot towards the mid-wicket area and gets himself another boundary. Moves to 128 now.\n",
      "Second innings...\n",
      "0.6--Will Pucovski--FOUR! Shot! A shortish ball outside off, Pucovski pulls this one behind square and gets his first boundary of the innings. He was ready for the short ball and pulled it nicely in the gap at deep square leg region.\n",
      "2.3--Will Pucovski--FOUR! SHOT! Second boundary for Pucovski. Short and wide outside off, Pucovski slams it through the cover region and it races away. The Aussie lead goes over 100.\n",
      "6.1--David Warner--FOUR! Fine shot from Warner. A fuller ball around middle, Warner strokes it through mid on. No chance for the fielder in the ring. That raced away.\n",
      "7.2--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Banged short and Labuschagne nails the pull. It is on middle, he swivels and pulls it through square leg for a boundary.\n",
      "8.3--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Nice shot. A short and wide ball outside off, Labuscagne cuts this one hard through cover-point for a boundary. You can't bowl short and wide to a player like Labuschagne.\n",
      "13.1--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Full toss down the pads and Labuschagne is not going to miss out. He slams it through square leg for a boundary. A gift from Ashwin.\n",
      "14.5--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Put away! Short ball on middle, Labuschagne rocks back and pulls it hard through square leg for a boundary.\n",
      "16.4--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! Nicely done! On middle and leg, Labuschagne flicks this one through the deep square leg area for his 5th boundary of the innings.\n",
      "17.5--Steven Smith--FOUR! More intent from Smith. He is not letting Ashwin settle here. Ashwin tosses it up and Smith accepts the invite. Doesn't quite get to the pitch but goes through with the shot. It goes high in the air but beyond the reach of the fieler inside the ring. A boundary.\n",
      "20.5--Steven Smith--FOUR! Drilled through the covers. Lovely shot. Full and outside off, Smith hits it hard through the covers for a boundary. Slightly wide from Bumrah and Smith pounced on it.\n",
      "24.6--Steven Smith--FOUR! SHOT! Fuller and around off, Smith lean on and creams this one through the covers for a boundary. To make things worse, it's a No ball as Saini has overstepped.\n",
      "28.5--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! SHOT! Fuller ball on middle, Labuschagne flicks this one through the mid-wicket area and finds a boundary. 100 up for Australia with that shot.\n",
      "36.4--Marnus Labuschagne--FOUR! LOVELY SHOT! It just gets easy to hit down the ground! Fuller and around off, Labuschagne stays still as he drives it through mid off. The bowler there tries to stop by going to his left but fails to do so as the ball goes onto meet the fence at long off. Excellent timing on that one.\n",

      "12.4--Shubman Gill--FOUR! CHEEEEEEKY! Wonderful stroke! Smart batting by the youngster! Kept his eyes on the ball till the last minute and then was brave enough to try this shot. Short of a length delivery outside off, Gill waits for it, opens up the face of the bat and steers this one through the backward point region to bag a boundary.\n",
      "15.6--Rohit Sharma--FOUR! Deft placement and timing on this one will send it to the ropes! Floated on off, Sharma gets low and paddles this one through the short fine leg region and even though, Warner gives it a chase but the ball wins the race to the ropes.\n",

It races away to the fence. He moves to 49. The boundary brings up 50-run stand between the two. A valuable stand.\n",

Siraj, again, continues his good form in this Test series and he breaks this new opening stand. Siraj dishes this on a length around off, it moves away after pitching, Warner is drawn into the shot and he swings his blade at this. He can only induce an outside edge and the ball flies towards the slip cordon. Pujara is the man there at first slip and he is not going to drop this.\n",
      "34.2 Will Pucovski OUT! LBW! Saini has his first wicket! What a moment this is for the youngster! A debutant gets the other debutant and Saini is ecstatic. India needed to break this partnership and Navdeep has decided to take matters into his own hands. He bowls this on a length outside off, moves in after taking the deck, Pucovski takes too long to get his bat across and misses his flick away. Gets rapped on the pads. The players appeal and the umpire obliges raising his finger. Will is not going to review this one as he knows that this was plumb. A fine, fine stand comes to an end.\n",
      "70.5 Marnus Labuschagne OUT! CAUGHT! Jadeja gets the breakthrough and Marnus, who was looking to get to his ton loses his wicket. The skipper takes a really good catch. Makes it to 91, but will not be able to cross the triple digit mark. Just the wicket that India needed and also at the right time. Jadeja goes for a short one and around the off pole, Labuschagne camps on his back foot and looks to punch this one away but the ball bounces a tad bit more and also spins away slightly, just enough to take the outside edge and go towards the first slip region, where Rahane gets low and makes no mistake. A sad end to Marnus' innings.\n",
      "76.5 Matthew Wade OUT! CAUGHT! Jadeja gets another wicket and sends another batter to the hut! There is always a sense of adventure about Wade and that adventure has made sure that he loses his wicket. He was looking good with his short stay out in the middle but that has been cut short by Jadeja and he is doing well to get wickets at regular intervals. Wade skips down the track as Jadeja goes for a flatter delivery around middle, Wade looks to tuck this one away to the leg side but he gets a leading edge and the ball balloons towards the mid on region, where Bumrah takes a good catch.\n",
      "84.5 Cameron Green OUT! LBW! Excellent bowling this by Bumrah. Green goes for a duck. After dishing out balls outside off, Bumrah bowls a length ball around off, makes it to jag back in. Green looks to defend but gets beaten by the pace and movement to get hit on the pads. The Indians appeal and the umpire obliges by raising his finger. Green has a word with Smith but decides against the review. A good decision as replays show that this would go onto hit the stumps. Green does not hang around for long.\n",
      "88.5 Tim Paine OUT! BOWLED! Knocked him over. Bumrah, you beauty! A fuller ball around off, comes back in slightly and Paine looks to have a push at this but plays it at the wrong line, there was not foot movement as well. The ball goes through the forward push of the Australian captain and goes onto disturb the timber behind. Bumrah has been lethal with the second new ball and has shown it again. Paine completely misjudged the line there and has to make his way back to the pavilion. Australia 6 down now.\n",
      "94.4 Pat Cummins OUT! TIMBER! Jadeja gets another one and the decision to bring on Jadeja is a masterclass by Rahane. Cummins goes back for a duck as well. Jadeja bowls this very full and around off, Cummins is late in getting his blade down in time to dig this one out. Cummins misses out. But the ball does not as it goes onto hit the off pole. A very good wicket for India and Australia lose their seventh wicket.\n",
      "101.5 Mitchell Starc OUT! CAUGHT! The rush of blood to Starc has made him lose his wicket! Shortish ball around middle and leg, Starc goes for the slog, but has no timing on that whatsoever. The ball balloons up in the air towards mid-wicket area, Gill from mid on runs to his left and completes an easy catch. A good cameo from Starc comes to an end. Australia 8 down now. How many more can they add now?\n",
      "102.4 Nathan Lyon OUT! LBW! That had to be plumb! Jadeja gets his fourth wicket of the game and even the review is not able to save Lyon. A full toss on off and middle, Lyon looks to play at this but he misses. It hits him on his boot. The players appeal and the umpire obliges, raising his finger. Lyon walks back but takes the review just to be sure. Ultra Edge shows not bat involved. Ball Tracker comes in and confirms that the on-field call is the right one. One last wicket remaining to take for the Indians.\n",
      "105.4 Steven Smith OUT! RUN OUT! Steven Smith is run out looking to turn the this single into this double. You can't take Jadeja on like that but he will be very happy with the knock that he has played. On a length and around off, Smith looked to push this one to the off side but the ball takes the inside edge and goes to the square leg region. They go for the single but Smith pushes for the double. Jadeja runs in and has a shy at the keeper's end and he hits bulls eye. The umpire wants to check this upstairs. Replays roll in and Smith is well short. AUSTRALIA END THEIR FIRST INNINGS WITH 338.\n",

The ball takes the outside edge and goes towards Saha, the substitute keeper, who pouches it nicely by diving to his right. Siraj is rewarded for bowling some good lines here. Australia lose their 1st wicket.\n",
      "9.2 David Warner OUT! LBW! Umpire's call on hitting the wickets. Ashwin has his man early in his spell. Both the Aussie openers dismissed inside the first 10 overs. A tossed up ball around off and middle, Warner gets down and looks to play the sweep but misses to get hit on the pads. Looks pretty good as the Indians appeal. The umpire takes his time and then raises the finger. Warner signals the 'T' after having a word with his partner at the other end. Hot Spot and Snicko detetcs nothing. Ball Tracker shows that the ball would clip the stumps. So, Warner has to go.\n",
      "46.1 Marnus Labuschagne OUT! CAUGHT! Taken down the leg side! The substitute keeper Saha takes a sensational take! A crucial stand is broken. Bowls a fast one on a length on leg, Labuschagne as he does so well looks to help it on its way to the leg side but the extra bit of bounce there means the ball goes off the edge and towards the left of the keeper. Saha, the substitute keeper dives full length to that side to pouch it. Can India capitalise on this opening?\n",
      "48.6 Matthew Wade OUT! CAUGHT! EDGED AND GONE! Wade's poor run continues as Saini has his second of the innings. Beautifully bowled there by Navdeep Saini. Bowls a length ball and gets it to rear up a bit around off, Wade looks to defend it off the back foot but ends up getting a thick outside edge which is pouched safely by the substitute keeper, Saha.\n",
      "67.4 Steven Smith OUT! LBW! THREE REDS! Just what India wanted and the technology comes to their assistance there. Ashwin bowls a nice tossed up ball around off,  gets it to turn a bit towards Smith. Steven there comes on the front foot to defend but the ball spins past him and raps him flush on the pads. Ashwin appeals and there is a shake of head from the umpire. Rahane signals 'T' immediately. Replays roll in. Firstly it is a fair delivery as Hot Spot does not show bat involved. Snicko comes in and confirms the same. Time for Hawk Eye now. Pitching in line, Impact in Line and Wickets Hitting. Three reds and Smith has to take the long walk back. India would be relieved to see the back of Steven Smith and now would hope to wrap the Australian innings quickly to set up the chase here.\n",
      "86.6 Cameron Green OUT! CAUGHT! Right at the stroke of Tea Green departs! End of an entertaining knock comes to an end. Bumrah finally has a wicket to his name in the second innings. Bowls a good length ball around off, Green looks to smash that through the off side but ends up getting an inside edge to the keeper. Saha takes it and goes up in an appeal. The umpire raises his finger there. After discussing with the skipper Green takes the review. Replays roll in and there is nothing on the Hot Spot but the Snicko detects a spike when the ball goes past the bat. The on field call stays as Green walks back. THAT WILL BE TEA ON DAY 4!\n",

It was all one way traffic until now but Josh has broken this promising stand. A very sharp catch by Josh. He bowls this on a length and around off, Sharma looks to drive this one past the bowler but does so slightly uppishly. It is enough for Hazlewood to get low to his left and grab this one out of thin air. The 70-run stand between these two comes to an end and the Aussies will be glad that they got a breakthrough.\n",
      "32.1 Shubman Gill OUT! CAUGHT! A good innings by Gill but unfortunately for him, it comes to an end. It has been a controlled innings by him so far but all it takes is one ball from someone of Cummins' caliber to send him packing. A fine catch by Green as well. Cummins darts in a good length delivery around the off pole, the ball moves away ever so slightly after taking the deck, Gill look to block this one but the ball takes the outside edge and flies towards the gully fielder and Green, there, gets low and takes a delightful catch.\n",
      "54.4 Ajinkya Rahane OUT! Dragged on! Big, big wicket. The one the Aussies dearly wanted. A shortish ball around off, this one comes back in a touch as Rahane looks to run it down towards third man. However, he ends up getting a big inside edge which goes onto the shatter the stumps. That kept low. Rahane cannot believe what has happened there. Massive, massive moment in the game. The dropped chance doesn't cost Australia much and the centurion from the last game has been removed. He was starting to look positive there but Cummins gets the better of him.\n",
      "67.2 Hanuma Vihari OUT! RUN OUT! Vihari is short. Stunning work from Hazlewood. A fuller ball just outside off, Vihari jumps out of his crease and pushes it wide of the man at mid off. He calls for the single straightaway and Pujara responds. Hazlewood from mid off dives to his right, stops the ball and hits the stumps at the non-striker's end, did that all in one motion. The Aussies celebrate. The third umpire has been called for and one replay is enough to send Vihari packing. His stay in the middle has been cut short, because of some stunning work from the big Josh.\n",
      "87.4 Rishabh Pant OUT! TAKEN! Pant's stay has been cut short. Hazlewood is the man who strikes. A fuller ball outside off, Pant without any feet movement goes for the drive but ends up getting an outside edge. The ball goes to Warner at first slip. It goes quickly to him but he reacts sharply and holds onto it. Great take from the southpaw. Not from the one with the bat though as it was way outside off and he could've had easily left it alone. A start thrown away again by Pant.\n",
      "88.2 Cheteshwar Pujara OUT! GONE! Huge wicket. Cummins is the man who has done it again. Big, big wicket. Excellent from Cummins. Good length and around off, it shoots off a touch after pitching. Pujara is glued in his crease as he pokes at it. The ball takes the gloves and goes behind. Paine is not going to miss out. A simple catch for him and he gobbles it. The battling knock from Pujara comes to an end and that leaves India in a massive trouble. They are still 143 behind.\n",
      "92.2 Ravindra Jadeja OUT! RUN OUT! Ashwin is short. Poor, poor running from him. A fullish ball outside off, Jadeja drives this to the left of fielder at mid off and takes off for the run. Ashwin is slow to react to it. Cummins from mid off throws the ball to Marnus Labuschagne at the striker's end and he whips off the bails before Ashwin can make his ground. Third umpire has been called and the replays show Ashwin short by some margin. Waste of a wicket this by Ashwin. Second run out of the innings this. India 7 down now.\n",
      "94.5 Navdeep Saini OUT! TAKEN! Starc gets the wicket with that short ball tactics. Smart from Paine to bring him back. Not that smart from Jadeja to expose Saini for entire six balls against Starc. Another short ball around off and middle, Saini is hopping to fend it away. This time the Aussies brought a man at silly point. The ball hits the upper part of the bat and it goes to Wade. Wade is not dropping this. Perfectly planned wicket.\n",
      "96.3 Ravindra Jadeja OUT! RUN OUT! 3rd run out of the innings. Jadeja clips this fuller ball towards deep square leg and immediately calls for two. The fielder from short leg, Labuschagne chases the ball down and scores a direct hit at the non-striker's end. Third umpire has been called for and replays show that Bumrah is well short there and has to make his way back to the pavilion. Australia have been excellent in the field especially with the direct hits. India 9 down now.\n",
      "100.4 Mohammed Siraj OUT! CAUGHT BEHIND! There is a spike as the ball gets closer to the bat, as shown by the Snicko. After banging three short, Cummins bowls a length ball just outside off, Siraj pokes at it without moving his feet. He ends up nicking it behind and the Aussies celebrate.The finger goes up but Siraj signals the 'T'. Replays roll in and they show a big spike on the Snicko. So, the onfield call will stay. India are bowled out for 244.\n",
      "Second innings...\n",
      "22.1 Shubman Gill OUT! Caught! Australia get the breakthrough. Length and around off, Gill looks to play this one off the back foot as he stays grounded inside the crease. The ball though shapes away a little as it takes the outside edge. There is an appeal and the umpire raises his finger. Gill though takes it upstairs as the replays roll in. Hot Spot comes in and it detects a spot when the ball is near the bat. Gill wastes a review as he walks back to the hut. Once again India fail to continue after a good opening stand.\n",
      "30.2 Rohit Sharma OUT! CAUGHT! Sharma departs against the run of play! Rohit looks disappointed there. He got out to a shot which he loves playing and has fetched runs for him but this time it is not to be. Cummins nicely sets up the wicket by bowling it on a length on the first ball and now he bowls a short one and invites Rohit to go for the pull. Sharma obliges but fails to get the distance this time as the fielder at fine leg, Mitchell Starc takes it with ease. India once again lose both their openers after a good start.\n",
      "35.4 Ajinkya Rahane OUT! CAUGHT! What a catch! That is nothing than a reaction catch. Australia needed it and Lyon delivers it. India disappointed after a failure from their skipper. Tossed up on off, Rahane prods forward to defend but does not play for the extra spin there as the ball takes the inside edge and goes towards short leg who takes a good low catch. Matthew Wade it is there under the helmet.\n",
